## Relevant Principles for dbt Projects

### Principle 2: Build for Observability and Reproducibility
All features must include logging, metrics, and deterministic workflows so issues can be traced quickly.

### Principle 4: Tests Drive Confidence
Write automated tests before or alongside new logic. Refuse to ship when critical coverage is missing.

### Principle 9: Simplicity First
Minimum code that solves the problem. Nothing speculative. No features beyond what was asked.

### Principle 11: Goal-Driven Execution
Define success criteria and measure outcomes against business objectives.
