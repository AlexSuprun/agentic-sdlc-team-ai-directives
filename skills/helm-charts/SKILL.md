# Helm Charts Skill

## What This Skill Provides

Helm chart design patterns including library charts, wrapper charts, template
helper conventions, and packaging and distribution workflows for Kubernetes
applications.

## When to Use This Skill

- Creating a new Helm chart or chart library
- Reviewing or refactoring an existing Helm chart
- Packaging and publishing charts to a chart repository or OCI registry
- Designing multi-environment value override strategies
- Building wrapper charts around upstream community charts

## Core Patterns

### Chart Library Pattern

**Rule**: Centralize shared templates in a library chart to eliminate
duplication across application charts.

**Implementation**:
- Create a `type: library` chart with shared `_helpers.tpl` templates
- Application charts declare the library as a dependency
- Store library charts in a dedicated shared chart repository
- Library charts cannot be installed directly — only used as dependencies

**References**: See @rule:devops/helm_chart_library.md, @rule:devops/helm_template_helpers.md

### Wrapper Charts

**Rule**: Wrap upstream community charts to control versions and apply team
defaults without forking upstream.

**Implementation**:
- Declare the upstream chart as a `dependencies` entry in `Chart.yaml`
- Override defaults via `values.yaml` in the wrapper chart
- Lock the upstream chart version in `Chart.lock`
- Add team-standard labels, annotations, and security contexts via the wrapper

**References**: See @rule:devops/helm_wrapper_charts.md

### Template Helpers

**Rule**: Define reusable naming, labeling, and annotation helpers in `_helpers.tpl`.

**Implementation**:
- Use `{{ include "chart.fullname" . }}` patterns for consistent resource naming
- Define standard label sets (app, version, managed-by) in a shared helper
- Keep helpers idempotent and side-effect free

**References**: See @rule:devops/helm_template_helpers.md

### Packaging and Distribution

**Rule**: Package and release charts through an automated CI/CD pipeline.

**Implementation**:
- Use `helm package` and `helm push` in GitHub Actions on version tag
- Version charts using semantic versioning aligned with app versions
- Publish to an OCI registry (e.g., GHCR) or a dedicated chart repository

**References**: See @rule:devops/helm_packaging.md
