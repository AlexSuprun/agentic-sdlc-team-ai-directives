# Rule: Prevent SQL Injection

## Checklist
- Always use parameterized queries or ORM query builders—never string interpolation.
- Validate and sanitize inputs at the boundary layer (API/controller).
- Enforce least privilege on database credentials; read-only where possible.
- Add regression tests covering malicious payloads (e.g., `' OR 1=1 --`).

## Rationale
SQL injection remains a top OWASP risk. Following these steps ensures every autogenerated query is safe by construction.
